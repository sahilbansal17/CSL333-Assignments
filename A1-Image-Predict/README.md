## Assignment 1 : Using linear regression to reconstruct original image from its downsampled image.

1. Read Image (512 * 512)
2. Down sample the image to (256 * 256)
3. Create the matrices required to use least squares regression method. 
4. Apply linear regression to get the parameters.
5. Use the paramters to predict the missing values. 
6. Display the reconstructured image. 
7. Calculate the Mean Square Error and Peak Signal-to Noise Ratio (PSNR) value.
