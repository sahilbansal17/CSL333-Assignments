### Assignment 3

- The logistic regression and neural network classifier (with single hidden layer) is to be applied on live dataset provided in Assignment 2. 

- The parameters are to be tuned for each model and all the models including SVR should be compared for the given regression problem.

- The dataset is to be converted into a fixed length vector format. Cropping, padding, clustering and histogram etc. may be used.

- The data can be split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. 

- It is required to report the mean output score for test data over 10 runs of the experiment. 

- Further, 5-fold cross-validation may be used for tuning the various parameters with grid search.
